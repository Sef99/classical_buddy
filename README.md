This is a simple Discord bot, mainly created for me to learn. I might add more features to it in the future. Using it is pretty straightforward.

Link to add the bot to your Discord server: https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=862140789933080616&permissions=0&scope=bot

# Requirements
If you for some reason want to run the code in your computer, make sure to install ffmpeg to your PC.

Link to ffmpeg: http://ffmpeg.org/

Also, you need an API Key to use the Youtube Data API. Read this to know how to get one: https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/getting-started
